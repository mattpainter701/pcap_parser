## Integration with PCAP Parser

This visualizer is designed to work with the PCAP parser in the parent directory. The parser outputs CSV files to the `outputs` directory, which are automatically detected by the visualizer.

## Visualization Controls

- **Drag nodes** to reposition them
- **Scroll** to zoom in/out
- **Click and drag** the background to pan
- **Double-click** a node to focus on it
- Use the **filter buttons** to show only MAC addresses or IP addresses
- Use the **layout buttons** to switch between visualization layouts
- Use the **search box** to find specific nodes
- Use the **export button** to save the current view as an image

## Customization

The visualizer uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can modify the appearance by editing:

- `static/css/style.css` - Custom CSS styles
- The Tailwind configuration in `templates/base.html`
